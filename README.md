# Lightstick - Work in progress
This is a WIP project inspired by one of [Stavros Korokithakis' projects](https://www.stavros.io/posts/behold-ledonardo/).

A Raspberrypi Zero W will be used as a controller for a WS2812b LED strip.

Users will be able to control the device via Webinterface.

## TODO:
 - add delay option for active rainbow
